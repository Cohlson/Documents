Question 2.
Explain the difference between Tag vs Element and Block vs Inline elements.
i. Tag vs Element
Tag
A tag refers to the syntax used to define the start or end of an HTML element. 
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). For example, <p> is a start tag and </p> is an end tag.
Elements 
An element, on the other hand, consists of the opening tag, the content inside, and the closing tag. 
For instance, <p>This is a paragraph.</p> is a complete paragraph element.
So, tags are the building blocks that define an element, 
while the element is the entire structure including content and tags.

 id – Assigns a unique identifier to an element.
Example: <div id="header">
class – Specifies one or more class names for styling or scripting.
Example: <p class="highlight important">
src – Defines the source URL of an embedded resource (e.g., image, script).
Example: <img src="image.jpg">
href – Specifies the destination URL of a hyperlink.
Example: <a href="https://example.com">Visit</a>
alt – Provides alternative text for images, improving accessibility and SEO.

 they are important because they help accessibility, readabilty and maintainabilty of web pages


 Question 5.
 Mention 3 accessibility best practices in HTML?

 Use Semantic HTML Elements – Choose meaningful tags like <button>, <nav>, and <article> so assistive technologies can interpret and navigate content correctly.
Provide Alternative Text for Images – Use the alt attribute to describe images, ensuring users who rely on screen readers can understand non-text content.
Ensure Keyboard Accessibility – Make all interactive elements (links, buttons, forms) navigable and usable via keyboard alone, supporting users who cannot use a mouse.
